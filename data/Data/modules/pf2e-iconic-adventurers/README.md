# PF2e Iconic Adventurers

Iconic Adventurers contains unofficial character sheets for the unsung Iconics who lack official character sheets. The creation and implementation of these unofficial sheets is aimed at allowing players to have accessible character sheets of every class in case they would prefer using a pre-built character sheet before building their own for one reason or another. These "Iconic Adventurers" are meant to be able to be introduced into games seamlessly, though as a Gamemaster please keep in mind you may still need to explain the mechanics behind a given class.

## Usage

The module adds two compendiums: one containing all the actors, and a journal compendium that contains a journal with links to all Iconics. I recommend using the journal to easily navigate which actor(s) you would like to use.

## PFS Note

Iconic Adventurers are not "PFS Pregens" so do not have any of the benefits that "Pregens" have within PFS. Instead, level 1 Iconic Adventurers can be used as a valid level 1 PFS character, and a player can utilize the free rebuild(s) prior to playing at level 2 or higher. Additionally, all Level 1 Iconic Adventurers use only the Core Rulebook + Lost Omen World Guide + whatever sourcebook the class was printed from. This was done to make them as accessible as possible within PFS.
