## Name Generation Process

See the [Quickstart Guide](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) for a quick but thorough overview of the module's features and settings and how to use them.

-   **Proper (AI):** The module uses a generative artificial, or simulated intelligence via an API to generate random names based on various options such as actor type, creature type, creature subtype, gender, language, genre, and other customizable settings, such as the inclusion of nicknames or titles and the rearranging of the parts of the name. Names can also be delivered in numerous different languages, both real and made up.

-   **Adjective (AI):** This mode appends an adjective to the creature name to just differentiate tokens (and perhaps offer interesting roleplay opportunities) This ensures extreme diversity and creativity that can breathe life into your campaign.

-   **Proper (Simple):** This mode uses tables of first and last names pertaining to several fantasy creatures to generate fantasy-styled names based on options, such as actor name (e.g. Goblin), creature type (e.g. Humanoid), or creature subtype (e.g. Goblinoid). This ensures varied names across different creature types. Names are limited to random gender names with mostly a fantasy style, delivered in English. Names are assigned to tokens automatically and can be re-rolled.

-   **Adjective (Simple):** This mode describes the creature with a random adjective, using a static table of adjectives. This is useful for quickly generating a large number of tokens with unique and interesting names.

-   **Numbered (Simple):** This mode generates a numbered name, such as "Goblin 1", "Goblin 2", etc. This is useful for quickly generating a large number of tokens with unique names.
