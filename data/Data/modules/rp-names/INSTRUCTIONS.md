### 2.1 Generate Names

Names breathe life into your characters and places, making them feel real and memorable. This tool generates names using various methods:

-   **Auto-Name New Tokens**: This setting automatically assigns a name to every new token that you drag onto the canvas.
-   **Refresh Button**: Manually refresh the name of any token using this button on the Token HUD.
-   **Context Menu**: Generate names directly for an actor using the context menu in the Actors sidebar.
-   **Chat Commands**: The **!n** or **!name** command in the chat window generates a name for any specified subject.

**Examples**:
