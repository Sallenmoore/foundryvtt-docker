# Changelog

All notable changes to the "Random Procedural Names" module will be documented in this file.

## Important Notes

-   [Web App Version](https://rpgm.tools/rp-names.html)
-   The first name created for any creature type will take longer than subsequent names, as the AI model retrieves extra names to cache. This process repeats every 4 names, as the cache is expended, or when generating a name for a different type of creature or using different settings.
-   Due to the unpredictability of artificial intelligence, responses may not come back in a usable format, so the module will automatically retry the request up to 5 times before giving up and returning a generic name.

## [1.11.0] - 2023-07-02

### Added

-   (Foundry) Added chat commands (These are available for supporters, as they require the use of AI):
    -   Generate a random name - experiment with anything you can think of
        -   **!n** or **!name** + **subject to be named**
            -   Example: **!n deserted pirate ship**
            -   Example: **!n chubby kobold**
            -   Example: **!n female ice giant**
    -   Generates a description for a creature|place|object - please be sure to specify the length and type of object in a single word (no spaces)
        -   **!d** or **!desc** + **length of description** (one word, or hyphenated) + **type of object** (one word, or hyphenated) + **name of the object**
            -   Example: **!d brief sword Excalibur**
            -   Example: **!d long village Phandalin**
            -   Example: **!d longish goblin Grizznash the Unworthy**
    -   Generates a random homebrewed creature|item|place|race|shop - this is so versatile, but remember, AI is not yet perfect
        -   **!h** or **!home** + **description of the desired homebrew**
            -   Example: **!h variant wolf cr5**
            -   Example: **!h logging village near Neverwinter**
            -   Example: **!h two-handed mace for lvl 10 barbarian, path of the totem**
    -   Queries ChatGPT for a response - ChatGPT built into Foundry. I know, others have done it, but hopefully not as well as I plan to. It is targeted to TTRPG topics, and focused on whatever system you are using
        -   **!g** or **!gpt** + **a ChatGPT request**
            -   Example: **!g A goblin walks into a bar and**
            -   Example: **!g What should a player roll to convince a peasant that he or she is actually the monarch?**
            -   Example: **!g CR for goblin chief**
-   (Foundry) Added whitelist for the proper name recognition, in case you want to repeatedly use actors that are being flagged, to keep the alert from showing after the first time
-   (Foundry) Added a colored container to the description chat messages to match the chat command styles
