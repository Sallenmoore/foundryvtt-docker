# Drehatlas' Maps

### Disclaimer
This module and the content included is provided to the best of my belief as is and without any warranty.
Install and use this module at your own risk.

### Description
This module includes both classical battle maps as well as adventure maps (bigger maps with focus on exploration and solving problems).
To distinct between these two types of maps I added a Prefix to the map names
 - [AM] for adventure maps
 - [BM] for battle maps
For the adventure maps I added short journal entries (journal compendium) to explain the initial idea of the map.
These journals are meant only and just only as supportive "collection of ideas" for your preparation.
Of course you are absolutely free to ignore the journal and use the maps as you wish.

### Module Dependencies
Hard Dependencies
 - Drehatlas' Maps makes use of multilevel-tokens. Therefore this module is obligatory and requested during install.
Soft Dependencies
 - Some of the maps use ambient sounds of the Game Audio bundle (1-4) and michaelghelfi modules.
   For full ambience atmosphere pleasure consider installing these modules as well if not already done.
