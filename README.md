[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cisagov/docker-postfix.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/cisagov/docker-postfix)

Creates a Docker container with an installation of the
[postfix](http://postfix.org) MTA.  Additionally it has an IMAP
server ([dovecot](https://dovecot.org)) for accessing the archvies
of sent email.  All email is BCC's to the `mailarchive` account.

## Usage ##

A sample [docker composition](docker-compose.yml) is included in this repository.
To build and start the container use the command: `docker-compose up`

### Ports ###

By default this container will listen on the following ports:

- 1025: `smtp`
- 1587: `submission`
- 1993: `imaps`

### Environment Variables ###

Two environment variables are used to generate the configurations at runtime:

- `PRIMARY_DOMAIN`: the domain of the mail server
- `RELAY_IP`: (optional) an IP address that is allowed to relay mail without authentication

### Secrets ###

- `fullchain.pem`: public key
- `privkey.pem`: private key
- `mailarchive_password.txt`: password for the mailarchive user

### Volumes ###

Two optional volumes can be attached to this container to persist the
mail spool directory, as well as the logging directory.  (Note that
the mail logs are available using the docker log command.)

- `/var/spool/postfix`: mail queues
- `/var/log`: system logs
