You can get a [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com) instance up and
running in minutes using this container.  This Docker container is designed to
be secure, reliable, compact, and simple to use.  It only requires that you
provide the credentials needed to download a Foundry Virtual Tabletop release.

## Prerequisites ##

* A functioning [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installation.
* A [FoundryVTT.com](https://foundryvtt.com/auth/register/) account with a purchased
  software license.

## Running ##

### Using Docker ###

You can use the following command to start up a Foundry Virtual Tabletop server.
Your [foundryvtt.com](https://foundryvtt.com) credentials are required so the
container can install and license your server.

```console
docker run \
  --env FOUNDRY_USERNAME='<your_username>' \
  --env FOUNDRT_PASSWORD='<your_password>' \
  --publish 30000:30000/tcp \
  --volume /data:<your_data_dir> \
  felddy/foundryvtt:0.6.1
```

### Using a Docker composition ###

Using [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to manage your
server is highly recommended.  A `docker-compose.yml` file is a more reliable
way to start and maintain a container while capturing its configurations.  All
of Foundry's [configuration
options](https://foundryvtt.com/article/configuration/) can be specified using
[environment variables](#environment-variables).

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file similar to the one below.  Provide
   your credentials as values to the environment variables:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.8"

    volumes:
      data:

    services:
      foundry:
        image: felddy/foundryvtt:0.6.1
        hostname: my_foundry_host
        init: true
        restart: "always"
        volumes:
          - type: bind
            source: <your_data_dir>
            target: /data
        environment:
          - FOUNDRY_PASSWORD=<your_password>
          - FOUNDRY_USERNAME=<your_username>
          - FOUNDRY_ADMIN_KEY=atropos
        ports:
          - target: "30000"
            published: "30000"
            protocol: tcp
            mode: host
    ```

1. Start the container and detach:

    ```console
    docker-compose up --detach
    ```

1. Access the web application at:
[http://localhost:30000](http://localhost:30000).

If all goes well you should be prompted with the license agreement, and then
"admin access key" set with the `FOUNDRY_ADMIN_KEY` variable.

## Updating ##

The Foundry "Update Software" tab is disabled by default in this container. To
upgrade to a new version of Foundry, update your image to the latest version.

1. Stop the running container:

    ```console
    docker-compose down
    ```

1. Modify your `docker-compose.yml` file or `Docker` command to use new image
   tag, or `latest`.

1. Follow the previous instructions for [running](#running) the container above.

## Volumes ##

| Mount point | Purpose        |
|-------------|----------------|
| /data    | configuration, data, and log storage |

## Environment Variables ##

### Required ###

| Name             | Purpose  |
|------------------|----------|
| FOUNDRY_USERNAME | Account username for foundryvtt.com.  Required for downloading an application release. |
| FOUNDRY_PASSWORD | Account password for foundryvtt.com.  Required for downloading an application release. |

### Optional ###

| Name  | Purpose | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| FOUNDRY_ADMIN_KEY | Admin password to be applied at startup.  If omitted the admin password will be cleared. |  |
| FOUNDRY_AWS_CONFIG | An absolute or relative path that points to the [awsConfig.json](https://foundryvtt.com/article/aws-s3/) or `true` for AWS environment variable [credentials evaluation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) usage | null |
| FOUNDRY_GID    | `gid` the deamon will be run under. | foundry |
| FOUNDRY_HOSTNAME | A custom hostname to use in place of the host machine's public IP address when displaying the address of the game session. This allows for reverse proxies or DNS servers to modify the public address. | null |
| FOUNDRY_NO_UPDATE | Prevent the application from being updated from the web interface.  The application code is immutable when running in a container.  See the [Updating](#updating) section for the steps needed to update this container. | true |
| FOUNDRY_PROXY_PORT | Inform the Foundry Server that the software is running behind a reverse proxy on some other port. This allows the invitation links created to the game to include the correct external port. | null |
| FOUNDRY_PROXY_SSL | Indicates whether the software is running behind a reverse proxy that uses SSL. This allows invitation links and A/V functionality to work as if the Foundry Server had SSL configured directly. | false |
| FOUNDRY_ROUTE_PREFIX | A string path which is appended to the base hostname to serve Foundry VTT content from a specific namespace. For example setting this to `demo` will result in data being served from `http://x.x.x.x:30000/demo/`. | null |
| FOUNDRY_SSL_CERT | An absolute or relative path that points towards a SSL certificate file which is used jointly with the sslKey option to enable SSL and https connections. If both options are provided, the server will start using HTTPS automatically. | null |
| FOUNDRY_SSL_KEY | An absolute or relative path that points towards a SSL key file which is used jointly with the sslCert option to enable SSL and https connections. If both options are provided, the server will start using HTTPS automatically. | null |
| FOUNDRY_UID    | `uid` the daemon will be run under. | foundry |
| FOUNDRY_UPDATE_CHANNEL | The update channel to subscribe to.  "alpha", "beta", or "release". | "release" |
| FOUNDRY_UPNP | Allow Universal Plug and Play to automatically request port forwarding for the Foundry VTT port to your local network address. | false |
| FOUNDRY_VERSION | Version of Foundry Virtual Tabletop to install. | 0.6.1 |
| FOUNDRY_WORLD | The world startup at system start. | null |
| TIMEZONE     | Container [TZ database name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List) | UTC |

## Building from source ##

1. Copy the project to your machine using the `Clone or download` button above
   or the command line:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/felddy/foundryvtt-docker.git
    cd foundryvtt-docker
    ```

1. Build the image:

    ```console
    docker build \
      --build-arg VERSION=0.6.1 \
      --tag felddy/foundryvtt:0.6.1 .
    ```

See the [Cross-platform builds](#cross-platform-builds) instructions below for
additional build options.

## Cross-platform builds ##

To create images that are compatible with other platforms you can use the
[`buildx`](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) feature of
Docker:

1. Create the `Dockerfile-x` file with `buildx` platform support:

    ```console
    ./buildx-dockerfile.sh
    ```

1. Build the image using `buildx`:

    ```console
    docker buildx build \
      --file Dockerfile-x \
      --platform linux/amd64 \
      --build-arg VERSION=0.6.1 \
      --output type=docker \
      --tag felddy/foundryvtt:0.6.1 .
    ```

## Hosting behind Nginx with TLS ##

Below is an example configuration that will serve the Foundry Virtual Tabletop
application at a specific path.  In this example, the application container will
be accessible at `https://example.com/vtt`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2 default_server;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    if ($host = www.example.com) {
        return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
    }

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/chain.pem;

    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://example.com always;

    location /vtt {
        # Foundry Virtual Tabletop routePrefix = "vtt"

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/upstream_log upstream_logging;

        proxy_read_timeout 90;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

        proxy_pass http://localhost:30000;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;
    return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
}
```

## Debugging ##

There are a few helper arguments that can be used to diagnose container issues
in your environment.

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Drop into a shell in the container | `docker-compose run foundry --shell` |
